# ðŸ§  SmartCard MVP - Autonomous Credit Card Optimizer

An MVP implementation of the SmartCard system that automatically recommends the best credit card for each purchase based on merchant category codes (MCC) and dynamic reward rules.

## Features

âœ… **Card Recommendation Engine** - Get the best card for any purchase based on MCC codes
âœ… **Dynamic Reward Rules** - Support for time-based rewards, spending caps, and intro bonuses
âœ… **Web Scraper** - Automatically scrape Bank of America credit card rewards
âœ… **Mobile App** - React Native Android app for seamless user experience
âœ… **RESTful API** - FastAPI backend with full documentation

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: React Native (Android)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, Requests
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler (for automated updates)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm
- Android Studio with Android Emulator
- Android SDK configured

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Seed the database with sample data
python3 seed_data.py

# Start the FastAPI server
python3 main.py
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### 2. Frontend Setup (React Native)

Open a new terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Metro bundler
npm start
```

### 3. Run the Android App

Open a third terminal:

```bash
cd frontend

# Make sure Android emulator is running, then:
npm run android
```

The app will launch in your Android Emulator.

## Usage

### Mobile App

1. Launch the app in your Android Emulator
2. Navigate through the authentication screens
3. Access your credit card portfolio and recommendations
4. The app communicates with the backend API at `http://10.0.2.2:8000` (Android emulator address)

### API Testing

Test the backend API directly:

```bash
cd backend
python3 test_api.py
```

This will test:
- Card recommendations for dining, groceries, and gas
- User and card retrieval
- MCC code lookups
- Summary endpoints

## Sample Data

The seed script creates a demo user with 4 credit cards:

| Card | Best Categories | Cashback Rate |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Amex Blue Cash Preferred** | Groceries | 6% |
| **BoFA Customized Cash Rewards** | Dining | 3% |
| **Amex Blue Cash Everyday** | Online Shopping | 3% |
| **Delta Skymiles Blue American Express** | Travel | 2% |

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `POST /users` - Create a new user
- `GET /users` - List all users
- `POST /users/{user_id}/cards` - Add a credit card
- `GET /users/{user_id}/cards` - Get user's cards
- `POST /cards/{card_id}/rules` - Add reward rules
- `GET /cards/{card_id}/rules` - Get card's reward rules

### Recommendation

- `POST /recommend` - Get best card recommendation
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": 1,
    "mcc_code": "5812",
    "amount_cents": 5000
  }
  ```

### MCC Lookup

- `GET /mcc/{mcc_code}` - Get category for MCC code
- `GET /categories` - List all categories and MCC codes

### Web Scraper

- `POST /scraper/run` - Run Bank of America scraper
- `GET /scraper/results` - Get scraped reward data

### Analytics

- `GET /summary/{user_id}` - Get user summary with all cards and rewards

## MCC Codes Reference

Common merchant category codes:

- **5812** - Dining/Restaurants
- **5411** - Grocery Stores
- **5541** - Gas Stations
- **5309** - Online Shopping
- **5912** - Drug Stores
- **7832** - Movie Theaters
- **4111** - Transit
- **4899** - Streaming Services

When you request a recommendation:

1. System looks up the category from the MCC code
2. Queries all your cards and their reward rules
3. Checks which rules are currently active (based on dates)
4. Calculates cashback for each card
5. Applies spending caps if applicable
6. Returns the card with the highest cashback

### 2. Web Scraper

The Bank of America scraper:

1. Fetches HTML from BofA credit card pages
2. Extracts reward text using BeautifulSoup
3. Parses text with regex to extract:
   - Cashback percentages
   - Categories
   - Spending caps
   - Expiration dates
4. Stores raw and parsed data in the database
5. Falls back to known data if scraping fails

### 3. Dynamic Reward Rules

Each card can have multiple reward rules with:

- **Multiplier** - Cashback percentage (e.g., 3.0 for 3%)
- **Category** - Spending category (dining, groceries, etc.)
- **Cap** - Maximum cashback per period
- **Start/End Dates** - Time-limited promotions
- **Intro Duration** - First-year bonus periods
- **Activation Required** - Whether user must activate

## Testing the Scraper

The scraper is configured to work with Bank of America's website. It includes:

1. **Real scraping** - Attempts to fetch live data from BofA
2. **Fallback data** - Uses known reward structures if scraping fails
3. **Respectful delays** - 2-second delays between requests
4. **Error handling** - Graceful failures with informative messages

To test via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/scraper/run
curl http://localhost:8000/scraper/results
```

## Future Enhancements

Based on the PRD, future phases could include:

- **Phase 2**: Automated scheduling with APScheduler
- **Phase 3**: Real-time routing with Lithic/Marqeta
- **Phase 4**: ML-based category prediction
- **Phase 5**: LLM-powered reward text parsing
- **Phase 6**: Partner integrations for structured data feeds

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Run seed script first: `python seed_data.py`

### Mobile app won't start
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Make sure Metro bundler is running: `npm start`
- Make sure Android emulator is running
- Use `http://10.0.2.2:8000` for backend connection (NOT `localhost:8000`)
- Clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`

### No recommendations returned
- Verify you ran the seed script
- Check that user_id=1 exists
- Try different MCC codes

### Scraper fails
- This is expected! The scraper includes fallback data
- Bank websites often block scrapers
- The fallback data demonstrates the parsing logic
